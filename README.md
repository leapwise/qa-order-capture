# Quality Assurance Interview Assignment

Description:
Evaluates the candidate’s QA skills using an e-commerce order capture system as the use case. The assignment emphasizes automation, exploratory testing, test strategy design, and the ability to handle complex scenarios.

## Part 1: Test Strategy

Scenario: You are tasked with testing an e-commerce order capture system with the following features:
- User registration and login.
- Browsing and searching for products with filters (e.g., category, price, brand).
- Adding products to the cart and modifying quantities.
- Completing the checkout process with multiple payment options.
- Order history and order cancellation features.

Task:
- Develop a test strategy for the system, addressing:
- Different types of testing and their necessity.
- Prioritization of features and scenarios for testing.
- Test data generation and management strategies.
- Tools and frameworks you would use for automation, performance, and security testing.
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies for the order capture system.

## Part 2: Test Automation

Scenario: Automate the end-to-end flow for placing an order in the e-commerce system. The flow includes:
- User login.
- Searching for a product using filters (e.g., “Electronics” under $100).
- Adding the product to the cart.
- Completing the checkout process with a selected payment method (assume a dummy payment gateway).
- Verifying the order confirmation details (e.g., order ID, product details, payment status).

Task:
- Write an automated script using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright).
- Include the following:
	- Data-driven testing for multiple sets of user credentials and product search criteria.
	- Assertions to verify order confirmation details.
	- Exception handling for scenarios such as “out-of-stock products” or “payment failure.”
	- Generate a test execution report.

## Part 3: Performance Testing
Scenario: The e-commerce platform experiences high traffic during sales events like “Black Friday”
Task:
•	Design a performance test plan for the “Add to Cart” and “Checkout” features, including:
  •	Scenarios to test.
  •	Metrics to measure.
  •	Tools you would use.
•	Provide a sample configuration to simulate 1000 users performing the “Add to Cart” operation.

## Part 4: Exploratory Testing with Automation
Scenario: Perform exploratory testing on the “Order Cancellation” feature.
Task:
•	Explore the “Order Cancellation” feature manually to identify edge cases or usability issues.
•	Automate one of the identified edge cases using your chosen framework, ensuring:
  •	Input validation (e.g., invalid order IDs).
  •	Assertions for correct error messages or successful cancellation confirmation.
  •	Test report generation for automation results.

## Part 5: API Testing
Scenario: The e-commerce platform provides REST APIs for order management. Below is a sample API for retrieving order details:
•	GET /api/orders/{orderId}
•	Response:
```
{
  "orderId": "67890",
  "user": "JaneDoe",
  "products": [
    {
      "productId": "12345",
      "name": "Smartphone",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 499.99
    }
  ],
  "total": 499.99,
  "status": "CONFIRMED"
}
```

Task:
•	Write automated API test scripts using a tool/library of your choice.
•	Include tests for:
  •	Valid order ID (positive case).
  •	Invalid order ID (negative case).
  •	Order IDs for canceled orders.
  •	Response time and payload schema validation.

## Part 6: Bug Reporting and Root Cause Analysis
Scenario: During testing, you discover that when multiple users simultaneously add the same product to their cart, the inventory count becomes inconsistent (e.g., negative stock values).
Task:
•	Write a detailed bug report, including:
  •	Bug ID
  •	Title
  •	Steps to Reproduce
  •	Expected vs. Actual Results
  •	Severity and Priority
  •	Suggested root cause (based on your analysis).
•	Propose a high-level fix for the issue.

## Part 7: Security Testing
Scenario: The payment gateway integration in the system uses sensitive user information such as credit card details.
Task:
•	Outline a security test plan for the payment integration, including:
	•	Key areas to test.
	•	Tools and techniques you would use for penetration testing or vulnerability scanning.
	•	Example of a test scenario for validating secure payment data transmission.

## Submission Guidelines

Deliverables:
•	Test strategy document (Part 1).
•	Automation scripts with proper comments and execution instructions (Parts 2, 4, 5).
•	Performance test plan and sample configuration (Part 3).
•	Bug report and root cause analysis (Part 6).
•	Security test plan (Part 7).
•	Submit all deliverables as a ZIP file containing:
  •	A single PDF for documentation.
  •	All script files, configurations, and reports.
  •	Include your name, date, and contact information in your submission.

Evaluation Criteria:
•	Test Strategy: Coverage, risk analysis, and practicality.
•	Automation: Code quality, edge case handling, and reporting.
•	Performance Testing: Realistic scenarios and key metric identification.
•	Exploratory Testing: Depth of observations and edge case automation.
•	API Testing: Test coverage and payload validation.
•	Bug Reporting: Clarity, detail, and problem-solving.
•	Security Testing: Understanding of critical vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques.
